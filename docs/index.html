							# What is Docker?

							Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to consistently, and reproducibly run applications.

							Docker runs applications isolated from the rest of the host machine, like a virtual machine, but with much lower overhead.

							## Docker Images

							Developers can package an application with all of it's dependencies into an image. This is a template for our application, which will later be used to create a running instance.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Docker Containers

							A container is created from an image, to be run on the host machine. This can be done with a single command, and does not require any more setup or installation.

							Since an image does not change, we can use it to run multiple containers of the same image, even on the same host.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Docker Daemon

							A service that runs in the background on the host machine to manage containers.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Docker Client

							A tool that interacts with the daemon, to allow the user to manage containers. Today we will be using the `docker` CLI tool, but there are others.
						</textarea>

					<section data-markdown>

							## Docker Registry

							After building an image, it can be pushed to a registry, to be pulled onto other machines. In a real-world example, you might host your own registry, today we will just be pulling images from the public [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) registry. This is the default registry, and contains many publicly available images for use.

							# Let's get started

							Navigate to https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ unless you already have docker installed on your machine

							Before you can continue, you will be prompted to log in to a DockerHub account. Create one if you do not already have one

							## Running our first docker container

							```
							docker run hello-world
							```

							This command will create and run a container from an image tagged `hello-world`. If you have not used this image before, Docker will not be able to find it locally, and so it will pull the latest version from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) before running.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## `docker ps`

							We use this command to get details about the running containers.

							Our `hello-world` container is not in the list. It exited as soon as it finished it's output

							This command will give us information about stopped containers as well

							```
							docker ps -a
							```
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							Let's run something a bit more complicated. This command will run a containerized Ubuntu machine.

							```
							docker run ubuntu
							```

							Like the `hello-world` example, the container exited as soon as it finished it's startup task. We can keep it running by passing a flag to make it interactive.

							```
							docker run -it ubuntu
							```

							From here, we can run commands as if we were in the terminal of an Ubuntu operating system

							# Running a simple static website

							## &#xfe40;
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							Some containers can stay running after startup. This example launches a simple web server as it's startup task.

							```
							docker run gps035/simple-static-site
							```

							The output on the command line says `Static site is being served...` indicating that the site is waiting for requests.

							But how do we access it?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Port mapping

							The site is listening for requests on port 80 internally, but we don't want to expose port 80 on our machine.

							```
							docker run -p 8888:80 gps035/simple-static-site
							```

							With the -p flag, we specify which port on the host machine should be mapped to an internal port.

							Now, we can access the site on http://localhost:8888 (On [Play with docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/), the port number should appear as a link at the top of the page instead).
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Running in the background

							After running the site, the server is running in the foreground in our terminal. We can see logs of the container printed when requests are made.

							We can run the container in the background by adding the detached flag (`-d`):

							```
							docker run -d -p 8888:80 gps035/simple-static-site
							```

							# Building our first docker image

							Let's make a folder for the contents of our static webserver project, and create a few files
							```bash
							mkdir static-site
							cd static-site

							touch Dockerfile
							touch entrypoint.sh
							mkdir html
							touch html/index.html
							```
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### `html/index.html`

							This is the file that will be served in response to HTTP requests.

							We can keep the page simple for now. Just add the following HTML to the files:
							```html
							<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
							```
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### `entrypoint.sh`

							This is the script that will run on startup of a container.

							```bash
							#!/bin/bash
							echo "Static site is being served..."
							exec nginx -g "daemon off;"
							```

							Just a few lines. We print some output to say that we have started, and then kick of our web server `nginx`.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							### `Dockerfile`

							This file contains the instructions for building the image.

							```dockerfile
							FROM nginx
							COPY entrypoint.sh /
							RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh
							COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html
							CMD [ "./entrypoint.sh" ]
							```

							Let's cover this in more detail
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre data-trim>
							<code data-line-numbers="1">FROM nginx
COPY entrypoint.sh /
RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh
COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html
CMD [ "./entrypoint.sh" ]
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p>We start by building on top of the <code>nginx</code> image that has been created already.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre data-trim>
							<code data-line-numbers="2,3">FROM nginx
COPY entrypoint.sh /
RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh
COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html
CMD [ "./entrypoint.sh" ]
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p>Then we copy the entrypoint script into the image, and make it executable in it's filesystem</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre data-trim>
							<code data-line-numbers="4">FROM nginx
COPY entrypoint.sh /
RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh
COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html
CMD [ "./entrypoint.sh" ]
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p>We then copy all of the static files to be served into the folder that nginx expects to find them</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre data-trim>
							<code data-line-numbers="5">FROM nginx
COPY entrypoint.sh /
RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh
COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html
CMD [ "./entrypoint.sh" ]
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p>Lastly we set our entrypoint script to be the command run by default when a container is started</p>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							Each instruction in a dockerfile is stored as a separate layer.

							This helps when iterating on changes to the container, as earlier lines will not have to be re-run, as the previous result will be used instead.

							To make the best of this, lines that handle files that are more likely to change, should be placed lower in the file.
